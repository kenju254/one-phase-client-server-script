# one-phase-client-server-script

This script demonstrates how to create a client-server program using Sockets in Python

## Introduction

The script sock.py does the following:
1. Open a Socket
2. Connect to a Remote Server
3. Send some data
4. Recive a reply 

The *Client* here is the *web browser* that is being mimicked in the script whereas the *Server* is *www.google.com*. In short, 
we are operating via HTTP and we would not be wrong when we talk about :

1. HTTP Server
2. HTTP Client
